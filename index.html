      <h2>My Story</h2>
       <p>I currently work at the University of Oklahoma as a MoneyCoach. I got into coding after <a href="https://ou.edu/moneycoach">redesigning the website</a> for the MoneyCoach Program. Using Adobe Experience Manager and a bit of CSS, I made the site more student friendly.
        <br>
        Once I finished the site, I was intrigued to learn more and found Techlahoma! Now I spend my free time learning web development. My goal is to become a web developer in fintech. I believe financial literacy is a critical life skill and technology can help make it more accessible.</p>
